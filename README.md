# Fatima Hobbies and things

I am an artist/project manager scholar at YearUp Greater Atlanta. I love art and the beauty of it.
On my free time I draw and paint portraits where I sell them on a platform called Redbubble. 

My favorite song is by Bryson Tiller: Keep Doing What Your Doing; the best song of all! I listen to this song on my free time when painting portraits. 
I love art museuems and art gallaries.
